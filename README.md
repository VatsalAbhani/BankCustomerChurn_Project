**Customer Churn Prediction and A/B Testing**

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict customer churn using a Random Forest classifier. 
It also includes an A/B testing framework to evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized retention strategy. 
Additionally, key insights from the data and model performance were visualized using Tableau dashboards.

- Churn Prediction Model: Achieved 86% accuracy using a Random Forest classifier.
- A/B Testing Results: The treatment group showed an 18% reduction in churn compared to the control group, validated through statistical significance testing.
- Business Impact: Provided actionable insights into customer behavior, allowing for targeted interventions to reduce churn.
